<h1>The Best Movies According to Leyi</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Dune</h3>
<p>I like Paul (obviously haha), Timothee is handsome. And Villeneuve incredibly changed such a greate novel into a great movie. </p>
<h3>Tenet</h3>
<p>The final space-time loop is awe inspiring. Your future is his past. He died in your past, living in your future.</p>
<h3>The Ghost in the Shell</h3>
<p>Beautiful retro visuals, and the deep reflection on human existence is unforgettable.</p>
